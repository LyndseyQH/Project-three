# Project-three
grocery tracker- python/C++
This project is a grocery tracker. It processes items purchased for the day and calculates how many of each item was sold and produces a test-based histogram. I utilized python for data anaylsis and C++ for formatting and menu options. I think the functions of the code does what it needs to and the I like the menu formatting and legibility I chose for the menu. The formatting of the histogram print out could use some work. The main difficulty I ran into with this project was switching between the two languages. I commented my python code pretty throughly but lost interest when completing my C++ portion. This impacts the legibility and maintainability of the code if someone were to take on the project later on. If I reworked it, I would add comments throughout.
